Peace and blessings. I'm [Jason](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jasontclark/). Long story short, I began my career in IT as a support technician in the late 1990s. Over the years, I've had the opportunity to file patents, publish invention disclosures as well as a host of technical articles. I'm a software engineer, and I've contributed to a number of open-source software projects.

But, I wouldn't be 'keeping it real' if I didn't tell you that part of my story includes a dream to create fun and interactive experiences, specifically in the form of mobile apps. I've made the personal decision to **FINALLY** take the steps necessary to achieve my goal and I've decided to take you, _John Q. Blogreader_, along with me.


## How, Swift?

That is the question.  Just like the belligerent outburst Kanye West made in this infamous Sway in the Morning interview (at the 0:44 sec mark):

How, Swift? I don't got the answers....... yet. But I will.

### The Path to Mastery

In his 2008 book "[Outliers](https://www.amazon.com/Outliers-Story-Success-Malcolm-Gladwell/dp/0316017930)," Malcolm Gladwell wrote that _"10,000 hours is the magic number of greatness."_ This means that if I want to become an expert in mobile app development, there's a TON of time that I'll have to spend doing it. At the time of this writing, I've only flirted with the idea of releasing an app, but in 2018 the real courtship will begin. I believe that the path to mastery will include 3 key areas:

- Education
- Good Ideas (for apps)
- Baking the Bread

#### Education

_"You ain't been doin' the education!! You ain't been doin' the education!!" - Kanye West_

At the time of writing this, your observation is very true 'Ye, I haven't. That stops immediately. For the educational portion of this journey, much of this blog is used as my personal notebook, capturing the knowledge I encounter and need to succeed.

In order for me to _"be doin' the education"_, I took a moment to see what's out there to educate myself on how to be a expert iOS designer/developer using Swift. Here's what I found:

**Design**

- Book: Steve Krug, [Don't Make Me Think: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability](http://a.co/9AYuHVf)
- Book: Nir Eyal et al,  [Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products](http://a.co/bkKzAyJ)
- Book: Pablo Perea et al, [UX Design for Mobile](http://a.co/1idUmBe)
- Book: George Berkowski, [How to Build a Billion Dollar App](http://a.co/f61x3PG)
- Udemy: [Sketch 3 from A to Z: Become an App Designer, Joseph Angelo Todaro](https://www.udemy.com/learnsketch3/learn/v4/)
- Udemy: [Mobile App Design from scratch with Sketch 3: UX and UI, Maxime Cormier](https://www.udemy.com/mobile-app-design-from-scratch/learn/v4/)

**Development**

- Udemy: [Learn iOS 11 App Development From Beginning to End, Angela Yu](https://www.udemy.com/ios-11-app-development-bootcamp/)
- Udemy: [iOS 11 and Swift 4 for Beginners, Ray Wenderlich](https://www.udemy.com/ios-and-swift-for-beginners-200-hands-on-tutorials)
- Udemy: [Design Patterns in Swift](https://www.udemy.com/design-patterns-swift/)
- StackSocial: [The Complete iOS 11 Developer Bundle, Grant Klimaytys](https://stacksocial.com/sales/the-bronze-through-gold-ios-11-bundle)


**Marketing**

[List of Marketing Books/Courses]

#### Good Ideas

_"People are so scared to lose that they don't even try." - Kanye West_

As far as ideas go, I've had a lot- so much that I have a separate book to keep them in- writings, sketches, etc. The goal is to turn at least **ONE** of these ideas into reality, though. I think that my approach to mastery will also reveal new ideas. Repeated practice and study often leads me in that direction. So expect to see ideas 'in the raw' around here- designs, sketches, video clips... you name it.

#### Baking the Bread

_"No one asks a chef how to be a chef. They just start fucking cooking food." - Cliff Bleszinski_

If you want to review my designs and source code, check out the [How, Swift? GitHub profile](https://github.com/howswift). If you want to see my finished projects, my completed apps are on the [Projects](/projects) page.

#### Contact

I'd like to think of myself as an accessible person. If you want to talk, you can email me directly at [github at howswift.com](mailto:github@howswift.com). Word up.
