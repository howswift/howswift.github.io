The title of this blog, "How, Swift?" is basically a play on the term "How, Sway?" and [Urban Dictionary](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=How%20Sway%3F) defines it best: _"Reaction to someone doing or saying something that is completely impossible. Unheard of, not realistic or hard to understand."_

# The Goal

I've watched countless ideas go from 0 to App Store. I've watched my own ideas (or ideas very similar to them) be developed by someone else. It's time...no, it's _far past the time_ that I **finally** ask this question- How? How do I develop an application, from beginning to end? There's much I want to accomplish on the way to becoming an expert mobile application developer. And honestly- right now, I have no idea what the hell I'm doing.

But, the preparation is real. In 2018, I'm releasing an iOS app, if not more than one. I have several ideas that I want to develop into iPhone/iPad apps, and the only way to do it is to learn Swift and iOS. Up, down, left, right, in, and out. Total immersion is the key. What can I do with Swift? What can't I do with Swift? Right now, I don't know. No excuse. it's time to really do this, and I'm taking you with me.

# The Plan (for this blog)

I'm a music creative. Nothing sucks more than sitting in front of an instrument with songs in your head and not having the ability to play them because you don't know the instrument. If that's true, then the inverse must also be true- if I know the ins and outs of the instrument, I can play anything I want. This is where I want to be with iOS development. I want to have an idea in my head, and within 48 hours or so, I have a working prototype. It's going to take dedication, and practice in order to get there, and at this point, I can't think of anything I'd rather spend time on.

Knowing this, there are several key areas to focus on: the design, the development, and the marketing of iOS apps. I need to consume as much as possible in all 3 of these areas, and that's what this journey is about. So, here's my personal challenge- with every post to this blog, I'm going to address 3 things:

- What have you learned so far?
- Show your work.
- Okay, now what's next?

I'm very busy these days, so I have to be honest about how often I can commit to writing. I think that I can honestly put in 30-60 minutes a week posting here on howswift.com, so you can expect to see 1-2 posts a week on my progress. The key is to stay motivated, get into a healthy habit of learning by doing, then share my knowledge with you. It's going to be a long ride, so let's get moving.

Here's to asking all the questions, and finding all the answers. Happy New Year.
