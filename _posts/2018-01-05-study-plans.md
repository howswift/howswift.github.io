Here we are in the first week of January 2018, and the question this week is, "How do I plan to learn everything I need to know?" The quick answer to this question is, "I have no idea." The long answer? Well, read on.

<!-- more -->

The good news is that I'm not starting from a place of complete ignorance. I do have some programming chops, and I've even spent some time playing around with iOS example code in the past. It certainly isn't enough- nowhere near it. If I use the musical instrument analogy (again), I'm taken back to when I was learning the alto saxophone in 6th grade. I remember learning how to read sheet music, and playing "Hot Cross Buns" over and over again until it sounded decent. I remember getting used to the neck strap, holding the instrument properly and learning where to place my tongue in the right spot on the reed.

(Inserting the proverbial Dame Dash "PAUSE" phrase here) => [PAUSE](https://youtu.be/cZpGpXZOBXU).

That's where I am with iOS development- finally familiarizing myself with XCode, understanding the IDE, getting familiar with Interface Builder, and using Swift Playgrounds to learn the Swift language. As promised, here are the answers to my 3 questions.

### What have you learned so far?

I look around the web for books, tutorials, and classes on developing iOS applications. Here's what I found as far as courses go:

- Udemy: [iOS 11 & Swift 4 - The Complete iOS App Development Bootcamp, Angela Yu](https://www.udemy.com/ios-11-app-development-bootcamp/)
- Udemy: [iOS 11 and Swift 4 for Beginners, Ray Wenderlich](https://www.udemy.com/ios-and-swift-for-beginners-200-hands-on-tutorials)
- Udemy: [Learn Swift 4 with Bob: The Intermediate to Advanced Swift](https://www.udemy.com/learn-swift-with-bob/)
- Udemy: [Design Patterns in Swift](https://www.udemy.com/design-patterns-swift/)
- StackSocial: [The Complete iOS 11 Developer Bundle, Grant Klimaytys](https://stacksocial.com/sales/the-bronze-through-gold-ios-11-bundle)

....and there' s more.

Starting with the first one on this list, I've already began taking the course and so far, I've developed the introductory app at the beginning of the course called the 'I am Rich' app. Armin Heinrich created the original 'I am Rich' app, which was a $999 dollar absurdity that actually sold a few copies before being taken down from the App Store. My clone of the app was incredibly simple to develop- there was no Swift coding involved. The app simply displays a UILabel that says, "I am Rich", and displays an image of a diamond on the screen.

### Show Your Work.

Honestly, there's not a lot to it, but the point of developing this is to have students create their very first app, introduce the students to XCode and the important areas/sections of the IDE, and iOS Interface builder.

### Okay, now what's next?

There are a couple of items that are next:

- Continuing the Udemy course, seeing how far I can get over the next week.
- Exploring XCode on my own a bit. There's an idea that I have, and I want to explore trying out a few things on my own, coming up with questions that I need to answer about this idea before embarking on the journey to develop it. I'll share more about the idea in a later post, but I will give you a hint- it involves music and video content.
- Finding additional books, tutorials, and other knowledge resources that I will probably need to consume at some point in my journey

That's it for now. I know it's going to be hard, but I'm determined to win. PAUSE.
