It's the second week of the year, it's 4:00am, and believe it or not, I'm getting
into the swing of this. When it comes to my dev skills, I have yet to leave the
Shire, and discovered that I have a ton to learn. Besides the collection of Udemy
courses, video tutorials, and books, I've established a learning regimen that
I'm determined to keep up.

### What have you learned so far?

Every weekday morning at 4:00am, I wake up. I fix myself a cup of coffee, grab
my headphones, sit down in front of my iMac and begin watching Udemy lessons.
Udemy isn't exactly my ideal classroom setting, but considering the iOS
developer classes that they offer and the affordable prices, it's a reasonable
way to learn how to develop apps. This week (building on top of what I did
last week) was the first coding challenge. The instructor for the course has
adopted a learning methodology that includes coding challenges along the way.
I can appreciate that because the coding challenges make sure that the knowledge
is retained, and I'm a learn-by-doing student. If I'm not writing code daily, I
tend to forget what I did, and the knowledge is gone forever.

Note: Don't watch this whole video. It goes on forever. Forever, ever? :-)

Enter the "I am Poor" challenge. The instructor provided a project "stub"
downloadable from the [London App Brewery](https://www.appbrewery.co/). The
challenge was to download this starter project, customize the main storyboard
using a UILabel and UIView to load the "lump of coal" image onto the screen.
It literally took me less time to complete the project than it did to build
and run it in the iOS simulator.

### Show Your Work.

Ok, here's a screenshot of it running on my iMac:

Again, not a very exciting app, but the point of the exercise is to introduce me
to Xcode and familiarizing myself with using the Xcode for both interface design
and development. Now remember, everything that I am doing is being committed
to the [How, Swift? GitHub account](https://github.com/howswift). You can
actually see where I included the ["I am Poor" coding challenge](https://github.com/howswift/complete-ios-bootcamp/tree/master/xcode-projects/xcode-i-am-poor) into my [complete-ios-bootcamp repo](https://github.com/howswift/complete-ios-bootcamp).
I've even come up with a branching strategy that will allow me to review my
own pull requests. More on that later.

### Okay, now what's next?

- Continued progress on this Udemy course. Watching all the videos, completing
all of the sample code, and committing my work to the [How, Swift? GitHub account](https://github.com/howswift).
- Researching iOS developers. From job postings, to tech bloggers, freelancers,
and etc. I want to begin knowing who are the people that are already successful
at this kind of work, and what it takes to become one of them.

That's it for now. Until next time.
